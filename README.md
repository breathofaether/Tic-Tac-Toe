# Tic-Tac-Toe

A very basic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. This project implements a fully interactive game where users can time travel between their moves. The base code is based on a tutorial posted on the official React documentation website. 

### Features
- **Time Travel:** Users can go back and forth between moves and see the previous states of the game board.
- **Move Sorting:** A toggle button allows users to sort the moves in either **ascending** or **descending** order.
- **Highlight Winning Squares:** When someone wins, the three squares that caused the win are highlighted. If no one wins, a message is displayed indicating the game was a draw.
- **Move Location:** Each move's location is displayed in the format `(row, col)` in the move history list, giving users a clear understanding of where each move took place.

### Technologies Used:
